0,"(reuters) - french oil and gas company total sa expects the global natural gas market to grow far faster than that for crude oil over the next two decades thanks to booming demand for the cleaner-burning fuel in asia, an outlook that underpinned total’s recent big investments in the space, chief executive patrick pouyanne said on monday. patrick pouyanne, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of total, attends a session of the st. petersburg international economic forum (spief), russia may 25, 2018. reuters/sergei karpukhin total expects to close a $1.5 billion (£1.2 billion) acquisition of engie sa’s liquefied natural gas assets in july, making it the second biggest producer of the super-cooled gas in the world behind royal dutch shell plc. “over the next 20 years ... we see many scenarios where consumption of natural gas will grow at a pace of next to 2 percent per year, versus 1 percent or 1.5 percent for oil,” pouyanne said at the world gas conference in washington, d.c. total’s numbers differ from those of the u.s. energy information administration, which predicts global natural gas growth to average 1.5 percent per year between now and 2050, versus 0.7 percent for crude oil. when total completes the engie lng acquisition, it will have 10 percent of the world lng market, from 6 percent now. it will manage 40 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of lng volumes, from 15.6 mtpa now and will boost the number of lng carriers it operates to 13 from three. pouyanne said total is investing in the entire natural gas chain from production to liquefaction for overseas shipping, to sale as a fuel for power, petrochemicals and transport. he said the global growth the company expects is being driven by low-cost production from u.s. shale fields alongside strong demand in asia, particularly in china. china this month threatened 25 percent tariffs on u.s. petroleum imports in response to u.s. tariffs on chinese goods, but did not add lng to the list. “i hope we will not lose the chinese market,” pouyanne said. but even if lng was impacted by the trade dispute in the short-term, total remained bullish, he said. “when you invest in something like lng, you’re doing it for the next 25 or 30 years,” pouyanne said. in an effort to create more demand for gas, total has also invested $83.4 million to buy 25 percent of clean energy fuels corp, a distributor of compressed natural gas and lng for transportation. as part of the deal, pouyanne and andrew littlefair, ceo of clean energy, said total would provide up to $100 million in a leasing program intended to place thousands of new natural gas heavy-duty trucks on the road. although total is looking to boost gas’ share of hydrocarbon production from 50 percent now to 60 percent in 2035, the company is still investing in oil. in march, total closed on its maersk oil acquisition, making it the second biggest operator in the north sea, while in the gulf of mexico the company in april acquired assets in the cobalt international bankruptcy auction.    reporting by scott disavino; editing by leslie adlerour standards:the thomson reuters trust principles."
1,"mexico city, oct 23 (reuters) - mexico’s president-elect andres manuel lopez obrador on tuesday criticized state-run pemex’s plan to import u.s. light crude from refiner phillips 66 , calling it a sign of the country’s failed economic policies. pemex is set to begin crude imports in november, for the first time in over a decade. it needs them to feed mexico’s main refinery, which is working below capacity due to a lack of light oil. the purchase of 1.4 million barrels of u.s. bakken crude will follow a tender awarded earlier this week to phillips 66. up to 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude imports are planned for the last quarter of 2018. “this announcement ... is another example of the great failure of neo-liberal economic policies in the last 30 years,” lopez obrador said on twitter. once he takes power in december, lopez obrador could force pemex to halt the imports, which would likely impact domestic refining and boost the need for other kinds of imported fuel. the issue has divided opinion among his allies. one of his economic advisers, abel hibert, said earlier this month that crude imports could continue as a way to increase processing levels at mexico’s refineries, even after lopez obrador takes office. “i think pemex has good reason to do it due to current market conditions,” he told local media. mexico’s light crude output has declined faster than expected this year, hit by operational problems at the xanab oilfield. pemex chief executive carlos trevino has said the company’s goal of producing 1.95 million bpd of crude this year will not be met, and that the 2019 target is also likely to be missed. if pemex does not start crude imports for its refining network, purchases of finished fuel, especially gasoline, would grow again to satisfy mexico’s consumption of about 1.5 million bpd, analysts have said. lopez obrador’s main plan for the oil industry involves building a new mid-size refinery to boost fuel production while reducing crude exports with the final goal of halting them. he has criticized his predecessor’s opening of the oil and gas industry to foreign investment, but has not given details of how he would reverse the country’s dwindling crude production. rating agencies moody’s and fitch earlier this month said cutting oil exports would imply a significant cash flow sacrifice for pemex, whose main source of revenue is crude exports. fitch changed pemex’s outlook to negative from stable.

2,"(reuters) - u.s. independent oil refiner phillips 66’s quarterly profit topped analysts’ estimates on friday as cheaper crude prices boosted refining margins by more than 45 percent. the company’s shares rose 2.4 percent to $118.76 in afternoon trading on friday. like its rivals valero energy corp and marathon petroleum corp, phillips 66 processes heavy crude from countries including venezuela and canada into diesel, gasoline, jet fuel and other products. but booming u.s. shale production has forced refiners to retrofit the distillation process to handle more of the very light crude from the oilfields of texas and north dakota.  “with roughly one-third of their crude slate being light crude, i would suspect phillips 66 benefited significantly during the quarter as did the other refiners,” said jennifer rowland, an energy analyst at edward jones. phillips 66 said earnings from refining, its biggest business, increased to $910 million in the second quarter from $224 million a year earlier. on thursday, valero and marathon petroleum also topped wall street profit estimates as greater processing of cheap, light crude from west texas boosted margins. the spread between u.s light crude and brent crude has widened this year with a rise u.s. oil production, which lowered wti prices, while brent crude has climbed on middle east tensions and opec supply cuts. u.s. crude production has been rising to record high levels since late last year, hitting a record 11 million barrels per day this month.  the widening of the brent–wti spread, larger discounts on u.s. inland crudes and improved heavy crude differentials all contributed to increased realized margins, phillips 66 said. “we expect western canadian select discounts to be attractive for at least the next 18 months and potentially longer,” chief executive officer greg garland said on a post- earnings report call, adding that the refiner has no major turnaround overhauls planned at its nine refineries in the third quarter of 2018.  prices for canadian crude have also dropped against benchmark oil as a surge in production has led to transportation bottlenecks. realized refining margin was $12.28 per barrel compared with $8.44 per barrel a year earlier, the company said in a statement. the refiner’s utilization rate, which is defined as the percentage of the total equipment or refinery involved in processing crude, reached 100 percent. chief financial officer kevin mitchell said in a call with wall street analysts that capital expenditure for the rest of the year will be between $2 billion and $3 billion.  earnings from the company’s midstream business also doubled to $202 million while profit at its chemicals business, which manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics, rose nearly 34 percent.  the houston, texas-based company said its adjusted earnings rose to $1.32 billion, or $2.80 per share, in the three months ended june 30, from $569 million, or $1.09 per share, a year earlier. analysts on average had expected a profit of $2.19, according to thomson reuters i/b/e/s. reporting by laharee chatterjee in bengaluru; editing by sai sachin ravikumar and jonathan oatisour standards:the thomson reuters trust principles."

33,"(adds conference call details for marathon, shares) by john benny july 26 (reuters) - two of the biggest independent oil refiners in the united states beat wall street profit estimates on thursday as greater processing of cheap, light crude from west texas helped boost margins. shares of findlay, ohio-based marathon petroleum gained as much as 7 percent to $79.43, while those of san antonio, texas-based valero energy corp rose 4 percent to touch $113.53. most refiners in the united states process heavy crude from countries such as venezuela or canada into diesel, gasoline and other products, but the u.s. shale revolution has added millions of barrels of very light crude to the supply mix. after reporting a doubling of profit in the second quarter, marathon petroleum chief executive officer gary heminger said business prospects should hold up “given strong global demand, wider crude differentials, and the changing dynamics of the low-sulfur fuel market.” the company said it plans to run 32 percent west texas crude at its refineries in the third quarter, up from 23 percent a year earlier. “as we look at our optionality and crude slate, we see opportunities to maximize usage of wti crude,” heminger said on a post-earnings call with analysts. valero energy ceo joe gorder said the refiner processed near record volumes of light crude in the second quarter. marathon’s earnings beat estimates by 24 cents, while rival valero posted a profit of $2.15 per share, ahead of estimate of $1.98. marathon’s refining and marketing margin jumped 36 percent, while those for valero rose 14 percent. margins were boosted by a discount on crude prices in midland, texas, which widened by nearly $10 a barrel against the benchmark during the second quarter, as production in the permian surged beyond pipeline capacity. lower tax rates also helped. strong crack spreads - the margin on turning crude oil into diesel, gasoline and other products - also spurred utilization rates, or the extent to which refineries are running at full capacity without downtime. marathon operated its refineries at near full capacity in the quarter, while valero ran at 93 percent and expects it to scale up to 95 percent in the current quarter. the rise in margins was also helped by wider differentials between western canada select, the benchmark for heavy crude found in canada’s oil sands, and u.s. crude as a result of supply bottlenecks in canada. revenue rose 22 percent at marathon, while it surged 39 percent at valero. profit at valero jumped 54.2 percent from a year earlier, also helped by a drop in biofuel blending costs to $131 million from $255 million a year earlier, mainly due to lower renewable identification number (rin) prices. rins, which are renewable fuel credits, are used to comply with the country's biofuels requirements. a surge in waivers to refiners seeking exemptions here from the law under president donald trump's administration has sent the price of biofuels compliance credits to five-year lows. reporting by john benny in bengaluru; editing by sweta singh
